<p>Here are some tips about how to upload multiple files to server by using FTP command line.</p>

<p>You can use <code>mput *</code> to upload all the files in the current directory. Or you can use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression" title="regular expression">regular expression</a> to upload some of the files with the same pattern, for example, <code>mput *.R</code> will upload all the files whose name is ended with <code>.R</code>. The problem is the terminal keeps on asking for your confirmation before a file is uploaded, which would be annoying sometimes.
If you donâ€™t want to be asked, input<code>prompt</code> in the terminal before using<code>mput</code>, and the terminal will show <code>active mode off</code>. Then the terminal will keep quiet and upload all the files.</p>
