Here are some tips about how to upload multiple files to server by using FTP command line.

You can use `mput *` to upload all the files in the current directory. Or you can use [regular expression][1] to upload some of the files with the same pattern, for example, `mput *.R` will upload all the files whose name is ended with `.R`. The problem is the terminal keeps on asking for your confirmation before a file is uploaded, which would be annoying sometimes.
If you don't want to be asked, input`prompt` in the terminal before using`mput`, and the terminal will show `active mode off`. Then the terminal will keep quiet and upload all the files.
